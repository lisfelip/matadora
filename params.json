  "body": "# Matadora CSS Lib\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThat's my personal CSS library, which provides a simple grid system and another useful auxiliary styles. No colors, no decoration, no theming.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install matadora\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Grid system\r\n\r\nThe grid is composed by a parent class **.mtd-row** (which represents a row) and immediately by a child class (which represents a column) is formed by 3 variables _.x-y-z_, where:\r\n- _x_ describes the screen size where that style is applied, intending responsive behaviour, it can be **lg** for _large_ or less, **md** for _middle_ or less, or **sm** for _small_ or less;\r\n- _y_ describes the size of that column, it's a value of percentage and multiple by 5, excluding zero and up to 100, formatted with 3 places (displaying leading zeros, if needed). For instance, it can be 005, 010, 015, ...,100;\r\n- _z_ describes the vertical alignment of that column, in relation with the others in that same row, it can be **t** for _top_, **m** for _middle_, or **b** for _bottom_.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n- the _y_ value still accepts the special values 033 and 066.\r\n- the _z_ value can still be omitted, if you don't desire to specify the vertical alignment, so the class name is defined just as _.x-y_.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"mtd-row\">\r\n\t<div class=\"lg-025-m md-033-t sm-050-b\">\r\n\t\tThis div will be displayed 25% wide on large screens, and vertical aligned at middle;\r\n\t\ton medium screens, 33% and top; on small screens, 50% and bottom.\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"lg-025-m md-033-t sm-050-b\">\r\n\t\tThis div will be displayed 25% wide on large screens, and vertical aligned at middle;\r\n\t\ton medium screens, 33% and top; on small screens, 50% and bottom.\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"lg-050-m md-033-t sm-100-b\">\r\n\t\tThis div will be displayed 50% wide on large screens, and vertical aligned at middle;\r\n\t\ton medium screens, 33% and top; on small screens, 100% and bottom.\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Generic using:**\r\n\r\nOptionally you can declare a column with no declared width, and defining just the vertical alignment, as the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"mtd-row\">\r\n\t<div class=\"mtd-col\">\r\n\t\tA generic column.\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mtd-col-t\">\r\n\t\tA generic column vertically aligned by top.\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mtd-col-m\">\r\n\t\tA generic column vertically aligned by middle.\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mtd-col-b\">\r\n\t\tA generic column vertically aligned by bottom.\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Useful auxiliary styles\r\n\r\n- **.ta-left, .ta-right, .ta-center, .ta-justify:** describes the _text-align_ property;\r\n- **.mw-1080, .mw-768, .mw-640:** describes the _max-width_ property, it matches with the available screen sizes;\r\n- **.lg-hide, .md-hide, .sm-hide:** hides an element (_display: none_) on that screen size.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- The screen sizes are defined as 1080px+ for _large_, 768px+ for _middle_, and 640px+ for _small_;\r\n- Matadora applies the property _box-sizing: border-box_ on the mainly html elements.",
